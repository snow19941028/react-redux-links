### React Hooks

> **Note**: Hooks are still an **experimental proposal, available in an alpha release**.  The API will likely change.  Keep that in mind as you try them out.


#### Official Resources

- **React Docs: Hooks (Proposal)**  
  https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html  
  The main resource for learning hooks.  Includes an intro with motivation, tutorials on `useState` and `useEffect`, discussion of custom hooks, the full hooks API reference, and an in-depth FAQ.  **Read the hooks docs first before looking at anything else!**

  https://dev.to/dan_abramov/making-sense-of-react-hooks-2eib  
  Dan Abramov provides a lot of additional context around the hooks proposal, including potential benefits like co-locating related logic, examples of how to use hooks, whether they are "magic", and more.  **Also a must-read.**
  
  
#### Hooks Tutorials

  https://dev.to/vcarl/everything-you-need-to-know-about-react-hooks-doh

#### Understanding Hooks Internals

- **React Hooks Demystified**  
  https://dev.to/kayis/react-hooks-demystified-2af6  
  Implements a tiny fake version of React, then illustrates how hooks are "just" implemented with some global variables, like an array to track which hooks were used in the current function component.
  
- **React hooks: not magic, just arrays**  
  https://medium.com/@ryardley/react-hooks-not-magic-just-arrays-cd4f1857236e  
  Describes how the "rules of hooks" are all about React's use of arrays (or linked lists) internally, with diagrams to illustrate how the behavior is implemented.
  
- **React RFC #68: React Hooks**  
  https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/68  
  The official RFC announcing hooks.  There's hundreds of comments from the community debating various pros and cons of the API design.  Probably not worth reading the entire thread, but some interesting thoughts in there.
